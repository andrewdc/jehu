# The Adventures of Jehu

A silly and fun little game idea my friends and I created in a HighSchool class in QBasic.

This time I am using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

If you want to pull this down and mess with it, here's what you need:

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

_you can use `npm` if you really want to, but frankly, npm has been garbage for me lately_

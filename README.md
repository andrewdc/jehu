# The Adventures of Jehu

A silly and fun little game idea my friends and I created in a HighSchool class in QBasic.

This time I am using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Setup

If you want to pull this down and mess with it, here's what you need:

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (just get the latest stable edition)
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

_you can use `npm` if you really want to, but frankly, npm has been garbage for me lately_

## Clone and Install

```bash
 # find a good place like /bestGameEver
 git clone git@github.com:andrewdc/jehu.git
 cd jehu
 yarn
```

This should install everything.

## Run Dev

```bash
 yarn dev
```

Should pop everything up locally at:

[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

Yay! On to adventure!
